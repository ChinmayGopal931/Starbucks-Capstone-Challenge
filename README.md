## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

The data is contained in three files:
- `portfolio.json` - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- `profile.json` - demographic data for each customer
- `transcript.json` - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ychbbq/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stakbucks for the data.
